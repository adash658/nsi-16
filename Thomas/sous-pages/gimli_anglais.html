	<h2> Description of Gimli </h2>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gimli is a dwarf of the Longbeards. 
	He is the son of Glóin and a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. His name comes from gim, a 
	Norse word meaning “fire.” Gimli is a famous dwarf who took part in every major battle of the
	War of the Ring. He proved his strength in the Battle of Helm’s Deep, on the Pelennor Fields, in
	Minas Tirith, and at the Battle of the Black Gate. One of his most renowned feats was allowing
	Aragorn to throw him onto the bridge leading to the entrance of Minas Tirith so he could drive 
	away the orcs with mighty blows of his axe. Gimli is the battle companion of the elf Legolas, to 
	whom he is deeply loyal, earning him the nickname “Elf-friend.” Like all dwarves, he loves fighting 
	and taking part in drinking contests with his companions.</p>
