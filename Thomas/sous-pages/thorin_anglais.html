	<h2> Description of Thorin </h2>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thorin is the son of Thráin and the grandson
	of Thrór. He took part in the exodus of the dwarves of Erebor toward the Blue Mountains after the attack of
	Smaug the Terrible, a mighty dragon of Morgoth. After his grandfather was slain by Azog the Pale Orc, Thorin
	led the assault on Moria, the last stronghold of the orcs, with the help of six armies of dwarves rallied by his
	father. He distinguished himself in this battle by cutting off an oak branch to use as a shield after his own was 
	shattered. This is how he earned the name “Oakenshield.” Thorin is best known for leading the quest to reclaim
	Erebor and free it from Smaug the Terrible, together with his company of twelve other dwarves, Gandalf the
	Grey—one of the five wizards—and Bilbo, a Hobbit.</p>
