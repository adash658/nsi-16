	<h2> Description of Erebor </h2>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erebor, or the Lonely Mountain, is a peak rising 1,067 meters high. 
	However, it is its underground part that makes it a great center of architecture and trade. After fleeing Moria because of a Balrog
	they had awakened, the Dwarves established a major mine beneath the Lonely Mountain, a place known for its mineral wealth. 
	There they extracted vast quantities of gold and mithril, making the surrounding settlements prosperous. They also discovered 
	the Arkenstone, or the Arcane Stone, in the heart of the mountain. This stone, which became a symbol of Dwarven power, was lost 
	during Smaug’s attack on Erebor, and later found again during Thorin’s quest.</p>
