                <img src = "images/wlrcover.png" id ="cover">
                <p id = "o1">This album is my favorite rap album of all time: <br>Whole Lotta Red, a rap album that was inspired by the punk rock <br>
                    movement and aesthetic. Indeed for this project the rapper changed routes and went from<br>
                    a more melodic sound on his previous album- Die Lit- to a very raw and electric sound, emphasizing <br>
                    the use of distorted heavy bass and sharp leads while performing himself alot more differently than before<br>
                    The entirety of the album was produced by talented rap producers suchas <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wakeupf1lthy/?hl=fr" target="_blank"> F1LTHY</a> <br>
                    and my personnal favorite <a href="https://www.instagram.com/direct/t/114381749952973/?hl=fr" target="_blank">Art Dealer</a>. The surge of new sounds and aesthetic inspired the new underground of today, <br>
                    the album being the true pioneer of rage, a new rap genre that dominates the market today.

                <article>
                    <p id ="biography"> Playboi Carti is a rapper from Altanta that I love because of his style and his<br>
                        ability of always creating something new to offer us: his sound is raw and expperimental and he is a fearless<br>
                        creative among the diluted rap scene of the 2020s. I hope you'll have as much fun as I had listening to him<br>
